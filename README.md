### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! My name is Emma and I am studying a PhD in Chemical Engineering. 

I used to do a lot of coding in school and lost track of it, so I am hoping to relearn and develop my knowledge further.



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my PhD! I am learning Python out of interest on the side, but hoping that I will be able to use it for data analysis, etc.
